<h3 class="page-header">Ground-based Follow-up Programs</h3>
<p>
    Due to the intrinsically transient nature of microlensing, it is vital that all required observations be obtained while the event is in progress.  This is no trivial task 
    because ideally the events need to be continuously observed for a period of days to several weeks, meaning that observations must be acquired from a coordinated set of telescopes spread
    across several longitudes.  Furthermore, the unpredictability of the events and their critical features means observations have to be obtained in rapid response to alerts.  
    To answer these challenges, microlensing has produced a number of pioneering programs designed to provided follow-up observations taken in rapid response to survey discoveries.  </p>
<p> Here we give a brief overview of those programs (in alphabetical order), and we refer interested readers to the publications listed on the project websites for an overview of
    their science contributions.

<p>The MicroFUN group is an outstanding example of partnership between professional and citizen scientist contributors, with targets selected and coordinated by a dedicated
team at Ohio State and data gathered by equally dedicated observers around the world. </p>

<p>MiNDSTEp combines a range of (manually-operated) telescope resources into a microlensing follow-up network served by a central, automated, target broker, the ARTEMiS system.
MiNDSTEp have broken new ground in the use of high-frame-rate lucky imaging cameras to improve the quality of photometry in the densely crowded microlensing fields.
