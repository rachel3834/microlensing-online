To contribute, please visit https://github.com/rachel3834/microlensing-online and select the branch "multilingual".  You will need to edit this Github repo, so if you could please create a Github account if you haven't already, and send me your Github ID, I will add you as a collaborator on the project.  
Then you will be able to
> git clone https://github.com/rachel3834/microlensing-online.git .
> cd microlensing-online
> git checkout multilingual
...and you will have a local copy of the multilingual version of the website. 

There are two different types of content that need translation: static strings, which are things like titles and comment strings that are used throughout the website for menu headers and similar items and articles, which are the pages of descriptive content.  

Static Strings
To translate static strings, please edit the file:
microlensing-online/locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/django.po

You'll see this text file contains lots of entries of this form:

#: outreach/settings.py:111
msgid "English"
msgstr ""

The msgid parameter contains the English version of the word or phrase that needs to be translated.  Please enter the Spanish translation between double-quotes in the msgstr parameter.  

Article Content
The article pages to be translated can be found in:
microlensing-online/static/site/
microlensing-online/tutorial/static/tutorial/
and are the files with the .html suffix.  

To translate these, please make copies of these files with the .html suffix replaced with _es.html and add them to the same directories, with the text translated into Spanish.  Don't worry about translating any of the lines starting with keywords like "PICTURE", "MOVIE", "REF" and similar - these are entries that my software will interpret.  The only keyword change you will need to make is from:
HEADER::LANGUAGE=en
to
HEADER::LANGUAGE=es

Once you're a collaborator on the Github repo, you will be able to commit and push the updated files, and I can build them into the website.
