<h1>How do caustics relate to light curve features?</h1>

<p>The following animation shows what happens when a source crosses
into a caustic (aka a <b>caustic entrance</b>): </p>

PICTURE::FILENAME=caustic_entrance.gif::CAPTION=Caustic entrance::CREDIT=Jennifer Yee::NAME=Caustic entrance

<p>There is a sharp jump in magnification when the source crosses into
the caustic (red). Once inside the caustic, the magnification declines but
always stays above the level outside the caustic.</p>

<p>A <b>caustic exit</b> is the inverse of a caustic entrance: the
magnification increases as the source approaches the caustic, then
drops abruptly when the source crosses outside the caustic.</p>

PICTURE::FILENAME=caustic_exit.gif::CAPTION=Caustic exit::CREDIT=Jennifer Yee::NAME=Caustic exit

<p>Because the caustic is a closed curve, there will always be two
caustic crossings: an entrance and an exit. The figure below shows the
magnification curve for a source crossing the caustic of a binary star
lens. Can you identify the caustic entrance and the caustic exit in
the light curve?</p>

<p>The caustic structure is often used as a kind of short-hand for the
full magnification map because the features of the magnification map
can be inferred from the caustic structure. Recall that a cusp is one
of the points of the caustic. The animation below shows how the
magnification is increased near the cusps.</p>

<p>A source passing near a cusp can produce a magnified signal without
actually crossing the caustic directly:</p>

PICTURE::FILENAME=caustic_cusp.gif::CAPTION=Caustic cusp::CREDIT=Jennifer Yee::NAME=Caustic cusp

<p>Notice the single peak and rounded form of the <b>cusp
approach</b>. A <b>cusp crossing</b> may also appear to be a single
peak if the distance between the cusps is smaller than the diameter of
the source. In that case, the caustic entrance and exit merge,
producing a single peak but with sharp, rather than smooth shoulders.</p>

<h1>Finite Source Effects:</h1>

<p>At a caustic, the mathematical solution to the lens equation gives
infinite magnification, but infinite magnification is never observed
in practice. Why?</p>

<p>When evaluating the lens equation, we get infinite magnification if
we assume the source is a point source, meaning that it is a
mathematical point with zero size. In reality, the sources are stars,
which have a physical size and therefore a finite extent. The observed
magnification of the source is smeared out by the face of the
source. If you wear glasses, this is similar to how things appear
blurry if there is a smudge on the glasses. In practice we calculate
the magnification of a source by integrating the magnification pattern
across the face of the source.</p>

<p>The animation below compares a caustic entrance for a point source
(dotted line) to a source with radius 0.01.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with transiting planet lightcurves, this effect
is directly analogous to the points of first and second contact for a
transit. The images below show a caustic entrance and the first and
second points of contact and a caustic exit and the third and
fourth points of contact. </p>

<h1>Exercise:</h1>

<p>Match the following planetary light curves to their caustics and trajectories. </p>
<ul>
  <li>In each light curve identify any caustic entrances and exits and
    look for cusp approaches. </li>
  <li>Also consider when the perturbation occurs: When is the peak of
    the underlying stellar event? Does the planetary perturbation occur
    before or after the peak? </li>
  <li>Finally, consider the location of the caustic and source
    trajectory: Where is the closest approach between the source and lens
    (where is the source closest to 0,0)? Where is the caustic in relation
    to this?</li>
</ul>
