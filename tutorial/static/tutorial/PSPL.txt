Introduction
The distances between stars are so vast that even our nearest stellar neigh- bors appear as unresolved points of light. This hasn’t stopped astronomers figuring out an array of inventive techniques to find out more about them, but it remains a challenge to study in detail all but the closest objects. Yet thanks to the curious effects of gravity on light itself, there exists a kind of natural telescope which can magnify distant stars. This phenomenon can teach us a lot, not just about those stars but about the ‘telescope’ as well.
The is known as gravitational lensing. When both the lensing object and its distant source are stars or planets, it’s called microlensing. It has the extraordinary property that it can tell us about objects that we would otherwise never know existed. In most cases, the lens – which could be a faint star half way to the center of the galaxy – is entirely invisible. Yet this technique can find and characterize planets around that object.
These notes describe microlensing’s fundamental principles, from the perspective of an observer on Earth. The movements of stars through the galaxy means that the stars we see are never fixed, and sooner or later the path of one star will carry it across the observer’s line of sight to a background star. The gravity of the foreground star modifies the paths of the light rays from the background source star, causing them to be focused. For this reason, the foreground object is called the lens. In the simplest case of microlensing, both objects are treated as point masses, and so this is called a ‘point source, point lens’ event. Of course, the stars don’t remain in alignment for long, so microlenses are transient events, which offer a fleeting glimpse of an unseen intervening system, never to be repeated.
