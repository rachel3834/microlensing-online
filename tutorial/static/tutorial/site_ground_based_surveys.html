<h3 class="page-header">Ground-based Microlensing Surveys</h3>
<p>
    There are three main ground-based surveys which have microlensing as a significant or primary component of their science program, outlined here.  The science produced by all
    of these surveys is too extensive and varied to reasonably report here; instead we recommend interested readers refer to the publications listed on the survey websites.

<p>OGLE is one of the most established surveys in microlensing, having been in continuous operation since 1996.  During this time the total area
footprint of the survey has dramatically increased thanks to upgrades to its primary imaging camera, now on its 4th version.  The OGLE survey is outstanding in particular for
the quality of its photometry and for its long baseline of observations.  This has enabled the group to compile deep reference images and catalogs of known variable stars which
are used to exclude false-positive detections.  As a result, OGLE issue a very reliable stream of public alerts of microlensing events in progress, which are available via their website or
 by subscribing to the OGLE mailing list.

<p>The MOA project represents a long-standing multi-national collaboration between Japan, New Zealand and the USA, beginning in 1995 with the 0.6m Boller & Chivens Telescope,
and progressing to the purpose-built 1.8m telescope in 2003, which greatly increased the survey footprint, photometric depth and resolution.  MOA operates a particularly
rapid-response public alert system for microlensing events and cataclysmic variable stars, available via their website and their mailing list. They have also pioneered the
introduction of alerts sent to a cell phone app, available for the Android platform.

<p>
KMTNet is the newest ground-based survey in microlensing and promises to be ground-breaking thanks to its combination of three wide-field telescopes at longitudinally-separated
sites around the southern hemisphere.  This means it can monitor microlensing survey fields 24/7 for a large part of the season, dramatically improving the photometric coverage
of events and hence the probability of discovering planets.  KMTNet began full-scale operations in 2013-2014, and do not issue alerts at the current time.
