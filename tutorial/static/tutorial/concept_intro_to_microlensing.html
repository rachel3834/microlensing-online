<h3> What is microlensing? </h3>

<p> Normally, light from a distant star travels to us in a straight
line. This star is called the "source." But if another star passes
between us and the more distant star, its gravity will deflect the
light from the distant star. Because it bends light, we call the
intermediate star the "lens." If the deflection is strong enough, the
distant star appears to be two stars. These are called "images" of the
distant star. </p>

<p> In the animation below, the source star moves behind the lens
star. As it does so, the images of the source change as a function of
time. The bottom panel shows the measured magnification of the source
star's light as a function of time.</p>

<h3> How does microlensing find planets? </h3>

<p> If the lens star is orbited by a planet, the planet will further
deflect the light from the source star.</p>

<p>We can detect the planet by measuring the magnification curve and observing the small bump it produces:</p>
