<h3>Introduction</h3>
So far we have considered the lens to be a single massive object, but binary lenses can result in complex and beautiful
microlensing lightcurves. Historically, of course, binary lenses have been key to the discovery of planetary systems. The following
discussion is intended as an overview of the mathematics and physics of binary lenses, and for greater detail you are encouraged to
review the references given.

<h3>The Binary Lens Equation</h3>
<p>A binary lens consists of two masses, M<sub>1</sub> & M<sub>2</sub>. The lens plane coordinate system (x,y) is arranged so that the x-axis passes
through the projection of the masses onto the lens plane, with the origin at the central point between the two lens masses
(Fig. 11). Both are considered to be at distance D<sub>L</sub> from the observer, their separation being relatively small.</p>

<p>The source plane is described by coordinate system (u,&nu;), which has its origin at the point where the optical axis intersects
the plane.</p>

<p>Each mass deflects a light ray from the source by angle &alpha; = 4GM/c<sup>2</sup>b. The total deflection is then the vector
sum of the deflections by each of the individual masses. Taking an example ray which intersects the lens plane at &xi; = (x1, y1),
the total deflection in the general case for a lens with i = 1 - n masses is given by:</p>

<table width="75%"><tr><td>$$\bar{\alpha}(\bar{\xi}) = \sum_{i}\left( \frac{4GM_{i}}{c^{2}}\frac{\bar{\xi} - \bar{\xi_{i}}}{|\bar{\xi} - \bar{\xi_{i}}|^{2}}\right),$$</td><td>[37]</td></tr></table>
 
<p>For a binary lens this becomes:</p>

<table width="75%"><tr><td>$$\bar{\alpha}(\bar{\xi}) = \frac{4GM_{1}}{c^{2}}\frac{\bar{\xi} - \bar{\xi_{1}}}{|\bar{\xi} - \bar{\xi_{1}}|^{2}} + \frac{4GM_{2}}{c^{2}}\frac{\bar{\xi} - \bar{\xi_{2}}}{|\bar{\xi} - \bar{\xi_{2}}|^{2}},$$</td><td>[38]</td></tr></table>

<p>where &xi;&#772;<sub>1,2</sub> are the vector positions of the projection points of masses M<sub>1,2</sub> in the lens plane
geometry.</p>

<p>We now write the lens equation in a form relating the lightray origin in the source plane (&eta;(u,&nu;)) to the total
deflection angle:</p>

</center>

<table width="75%"><tr><td>$$\bar{\eta} = \bar{\xi}\frac{D_{S}}{D_{L}} - D_{LS}\bar{\alpha}(\bar{\xi}),$$</td><td>[39]</td></tr></table>

<p>By substituting Eqn. 38 into 39 we get:</p>

<table width="75%"><tr><td>$$\frac{\bar{\eta}}{D_{S}} = \frac{\bar{\xi}}{D_{L}} - \frac{4GM_{1}}{c^{2}}\frac{\bar{\xi} - \bar{\xi_{1}}}{|\bar{\xi} - \bar{\xi_{1}}|^{2}}\frac{D_{LS}}{D_{S}} - \frac{4GM_{2}}{c^{2}}\frac{\bar{\xi} - \bar{\xi_{2}}}{|\bar{\xi} - \bar{\xi_{2}}|^{2}}\frac{D_{LS}}{D_{S}},$$</td><td>[40]</td></tr></table>

<p>This is simplified by declaring:</p>

<table width="75%">
	<tr><td>$$\bar{w}(u,\nu) = \frac{\bar{\eta}}{D_{S}},$$</td><td></td></tr>
	<tr><td>$$\bar{z}(x,y) = \frac{\bar{\xi}}{D_{L}},$$</td><td></td></tr>
	<tr><td>$$m_{i} = \frac{4GM_{i}D_{LS}D_{L}}{c^{2}D_{S}},$$</td><td>[40]</td></tr>
</table>

<p>and we arrive at:</p>

<table width="75%"><tr><td>$$\bar{w} = \bar{z} - m_{1}\frac{\bar{z} - \bar{z_{1}}}{|\bar{z} - \bar{z_{1}}|^{2}} - m_{2}\frac{\bar{z} - \bar{z_{1}}}{|\bar{z} - \bar{z_{1}}|^{2}},$$</td><td>[41]</td></tr></table>

<p>As before, this represents a mapping between the source and lens planes. A lightray from point w&#772;(u,&nu;) in the source plane
will hit the lens plane at z&#772;(x,y). The inverse problem, extracting the locations of the source images in the lens plane
geometry requires complex root-finding techniques explored in detail by Schneider & Weiss (1986). In complex notation, Eqn. 41
becomes:</p>

<table width="75%"><tr><td>$$w = z - m_{1}\frac{1}{\bar{z} - \bar{z_{1}}} - m_{2}\frac{1}{\bar{z} - \bar{z_{2}}},$$</td><td>[42]</td></tr></table>

<p>where w, z are complex numbers:</p>

<table width="75%">
	<tr><td>$$w = u + i\nu,$$</td><td></td></tr>
	<tr><td>$$z = x = iy,$$</td><td>[43]</td></tr>
</table>

<p>and z&#772; is the complex conjugate of z.</p>

<h3>Source Images</h3>

<p>To find the number and locations of the source images produced we need to produce an expression for z in terms of w - the
inverse of the lens equation. The complex conjugate of Eqn. 42 is:</p>

<table width="75%"><tr><td>$$\bar{w} = \bar{z} - m_{1}\frac{1}{z - z_{1}} - m_{2}\frac{1}{z - z_{2}}.$$</td><td>[44]</td></tr></table>

<p>Solving this expression for z&#772; and substituting into Eqn. 42, we get:</p>

<table width="75%"><tr><td>$$z = w + \sum_{i=1,2}m_{i}\left[\bar{w} - \bar{z_{i}} + \sum_{k=1,2}m_{k}(z - z_{k})^{-1}\right]^{-1}.$$</td><td>[45]</td></tr></table>

<p>This expression generates a polynomial equation in z of order (n<sup>2</sup> + 1), where n is the number of lensing masses.
Therefore, for a binary lens, there are up to 5 solutions, of which either 3 or 5 may be real, depending on the lens-source
projected separation (see later discussion, and references).
</p>

<h3>Amplification for a binary lens</h3>

<p>Following similar arguments used to derive the amplification of a single-mass lens, that for a binary lens is, as before, the
inverse of the area distortion of the lens mapping (compare with Eqn. 16):
</p>

<table width="75%"><tr><td>$$A = \left| det \frac{\partial\bar{w}(u,\nu)}{\partial\bar{z}(x,y)} \right|^{-1},$$</td><td>[46]</td></tr></table>

<p>To derive an expression for this we need the 'gradient' of a vector function, or the matrix of first-order partial derivatives,
known as the Jacobian matrix, which may be written:
</p>

<table width="75%">
	<tr><td>$$J = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \\ \frac{\partial \nu}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial \nu}{\partial y} \end{bmatrix}$$</td></tr>	
	<tr><td>$$J = \left| \frac{\partial w}{\partial z} \right|^{2} - \left|\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}\right|^{2},$$</td><td>[47]</td></tr>
</table>

<p>which for n lensing bodies is:</p>

<table width="75%"><tr><td>$$J = 1 - \left[ \sum_{n} m_{n}(\bar{z} - \bar{z_{n}})^{-2}\right]^{2} = 1 - (\bar{\kappa})^{2},$$</td><td>[48]</td></tr></table>

<p>and for a binary lens is:</p>

<table width="75%"><tr><td>$$J = 1 - \left( \frac{m_{1}}{(\bar{z} - \bar{z_{1}})^{2}} + \frac{m_{2}}{(\bar{z} - \bar{z_{2}})^{2}}\right)^{2},$$</td><td>[48]</td></tr></table>

<p>The inverse Jacobian matrix elements are:</p>

<table width="75%">
	<tr><td>$$\frac{\partial z}{\partial w} = \frac{1}{J},$$</td><td></td></tr>
	<tr><td>$$\frac{\partial z}{\partial \bar{w}} = -\frac{\bar{\kappa}}{J},$$</td><td>[49]</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The total amplification is given by the sum of the absolute amplification of each image i:</p>

<table width="75%"><tr><td>$$A = \sum_{i=1}^{n}A_{i} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}|\det J|^{-1}.$$</td><td>[50]</td></tr></table>

<h3>Critical Curves and Caustics</h3>

<p>Mathematically, the nature of this solution has a curious feature. As the source moves behind the binary lens, there are certain
positions in the source plane for which the resulting Jacobian determinant drops to zero:</p>

<table width="75%"><tr><td>$$\det J = 0.$$</td><td>[51]</td></tr></table>

<p>These positions form graceful curves, known as 'critical curves'.</p>

<p>Theoretically, as the source crosses the critical curve, the amplification becomes inifinite, according to Eqn. 50. In reality,
finite source effects curtail the amplification to merely 'high', but these situations can still result in very dramatic
brightenings of the source by several magnitudes.</p>

<p>Applying the lens equation, the positions of the critical curve in the source plane can be mapped into the lens plane geometry -
resulting in generally spiky curves known as 'caustics'. Both are illustrated in Fig. 12.</p>

<table>

        </td></tr>
</table>

<p>The number of images changes as the source moves across the caustic curve. Outside it, there are three images; one outside the
critical curve and two inside it, usually close to one of the masses. Whereas when the source lies within the region defined by the
caustic, two more images exist, one inside and one outside the critical curve. Its interesting to bear in mind that the caustic
curve represents the maximum amplification, and the amplification within the caustic actually drops. For wide binary lenses, the
amplification mid-caustic can drop back almost to baseline.</p>

<p>The expressions derived here depend on the ratio, q, of the masses of the lensing bodies and their positions in the lens plane.
These factors dictate the shape and extent of the caustics and a wide variety of shapes are possible. The source can also take any
trajectory, relative to the lens geometry. A wide range of lightcurves can result, but one common feature is a 'double-peak'
structure - the first peak caused by the source crossing into the caustic region, the second caused by it exiting the caustic.
Depending on the size of the caustic, the trajectory and relative velocity, the peaks can be hours or days apart.</p>

<p>Notice though, that a binary lens of any q will produce caustics. Therefore, if the source has a favourable relative trajectory,
even an extreme mass ratio binary like a planetary system will produce a detectable amplification. This makes microlensing uniquely
sensitive to even low mass planetary companions. However, the caustic region for low mass ratio lenses is generally smaller, so the
crossing time (the duration of the anomaly) is usually shorter (depending on the velocities of source and lens) and requires
better lightcurve cadence to detect. The probability of the source trajectory crossing the caustic is also smaller, but this is
factor compensated for by surveys covering large numbers of stars.
