<p>In microlensing, the <b>caustic</b> corresponds to the position(s) of the
source for which the solution of the lens equation results in infinite
magnification. For a point lens (e.g. a single star), the magnification equation is:</p>

<table class="fraction" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="2" nowrap="nowrap">
	  Magnification = &nbsp;
        </td>
        <td rowspan="2" nowrap="nowrap">
            <i> A(u)</i> =  &nbsp;
        </td>
        <td nowrap="nowrap">
            <i>u</i><sup>2</sup> + 2
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="upper_line">
            <i>u</i> (<i>u</i><sup>2</sup> + 4 )<sup>1/2</sup>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>where u is the source positions. If you solve this equation for u=0,
you will find that the magnification, A, is infinite. Thus, for a
point lens, the caustic is a single point at u=0.</p>

<p>For a 2-body lens (such as a star+planet), the magnification equation
is more complex, but it remains true that there are solutions to this
equation for which the magnification is infinite. In this case, the
caustic is a closed curve, or set of closed curves, and at those
curves the magnification diverges to infinity.</p>

<p>By solving the lens equation, it is possible to calculate the
magnification of the source at any (projected) position relative to
the position of the lens. The <b>magnification map</b> is a
visualization reflecting the calculated magnification at a given point
(brighter=more highly magnified). The image below shows the
magnification map and caustic structure for a 2-body lens.</p>

<p>Some general rules about caustics:

<ol>
<li> <p>They are closed curves. Therefore, they have an inside and an
outside. (The perimeter of a square or a triangle are other examples
of closed curves. But remember that the caustic refers to the edge of
the shape and not the shape itself.)</p> 
PICTURE::FILENAME=caustic_inout.jpg::CAPTION=Caustic description::CREDIT=Jennifer Yee::NAME=Caustic description
</li>

<li> The caustic has zero width. (A mathematical line also has
zero width.)</li>

<li> The magnification diverges to infinity  at the caustic.</li>

<li> The magnification inside of the caustic is always greater than the
magnification outside of the caustic.</li>

<li> <p>The points of a caustic are called <b>cusps</b>. The curved segments
connecting the cusps are called <b>folds</b>.</p>
